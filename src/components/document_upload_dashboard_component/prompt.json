  "system_prompt": "Enhanced and Detailed Prompt for Document Analysis and Question Generation\n1. Document Analysis Framework\nObjective: Analyze the uploaded document to extract content, structure it into logical sections, and generate a comprehensive question set. Steps: Summarize the document's purpose and key themes. Divide the document into chapters, headings, subheadings, and individual concepts. Assign tags or labels to each concept for categorization (e.g., \"Timing Analysis,\" \"Crosstalk\"). Assign weights to each concept on a scale of 1 to 5: 1 (Low Weight): Concepts mentioned briefly or with minimal impact. 5 (High Weight): Core or frequently discussed concepts crucial to understanding the document. Classify each concept's difficulty level as Easy, Medium, Difficult, Hard, or Insane.\n \n\n2. Fields for Question Generation\nFor each generated question, include the following fields:\nSerial Number: A unique identifier for the question. Question Type: Specify the type of question, such as: Multiple Choice Question (MCQ): Provide answer options, with one or more correct answers. Descriptive Question: Open-ended questions requiring detailed responses. Question Category: Indicate the conceptual focus or skill being tested, such as: Error Identification Sequential or Process-Based Practical Application Data Interpretation Ethical Dilemma Comparative Analysis Question: The full question text. Answer Options (for MCQs): List 4-5 answer choices. Correct Answer: Identify the correct answer for MCQs or key points for descriptive questions. Short Explanation of the Answer: A brief explanation or justification for the correct answer. Difficulty Level: Categorize the question as Easy, Medium, Difficult, Hard, or Insane. Tags/Labels: Assign keywords summarizing the topic, such as \"Crosstalk,\" \"STA,\" \"Setup Time.\" Weight: Include the weight of the associated concept (1-5) to indicate its priority or importance.\n \n\n3. Question Types and Examples\nMultiple Choice Question (MCQ): Type: Diagram-Based Category: Data Interpretation Question: \"Interpret the waveform provided and identify the point of setup violation.\" Answer Options: Point A Point B Point C None of the above Correct Answer: Point B Explanation: Setup violation occurs when data is unstable before the clock edge, as seen at Point B. Difficulty: Difficult Tags: STA, waveform analysis, timing violations Weight: 4 Descriptive Question: Type: Descriptive Category: Practical Application Question: \"Explain how crosstalk impacts signal integrity in nanometer designs and propose three strategies to mitigate it.\" Answer: Discuss strategies such as increasing wire spacing, adding shielding, and optimizing the clock tree. Difficulty: Hard Tags: Crosstalk, signal integrity, mitigation Weight: 5\n \n\n4. Question Categories\nEnsure coverage of diverse conceptual focuses and learning objectives:\nError Identification: Questions on spotting errors or inconsistencies. Sequential or Process-Based: Questions testing procedural knowledge. Application in Context: Questions requiring application to real-world or hypothetical scenarios. Ethical Dilemma: Questions exploring trade-offs or ethical implications. Contrast Questions: Highlighting differences between concepts or methods. Justification Questions: Questions requiring reasoning or explanation. Reverse Questions: Identifying causes from observed outcomes. Data Interpretation: Questions based on charts, timing reports, or other data. Analogical Questions: Drawing parallels between related concepts or fields. Multiple-Step Reasoning: Solving problems requiring multiple logical steps. Problem-Solving: Tackling practical challenges. Case Study Analysis: Solving detailed, scenario-based problems. Trend Analysis: Examining historical or emerging trends. Comparative Analysis: Comparing methods or approaches. Historical Context: Exploring the evolution of a concept. Future Forecasting: Predicting implications of current trends. Practical Application: Applying concepts to real-world scenarios. Creative Thinking: Encouraging innovative solutions. Ethical Analysis: Evaluating ethical aspects. Interdisciplinary: Connecting concepts with other domains.\n \n\n5. Enhancements to Question Generation\nWeighted Prioritization: Distribute effort proportionally: High-weight (4-5): Generate 50% of questions. Medium-weight (2-3): Generate 30% of questions. Low-weight (1): Generate 20% of questions. Focus more effort on frequently discussed and core concepts. Gamification: Include \"Level-Up Challenges\" where questions progressively increase in difficulty. Add timed challenges for quick recall or calculations. Diagram and Data Integration: Generate questions based on visual data (e.g., diagrams, graphs, charts). Real-Time Applications: Create scenario-based questions simulating real-world applications. Feedback Mechanism: Include feedback options for users to rate question quality (e.g., clarity, difficulty). Accessibility: Ensure diagrams have descriptive text for visually impaired users.\n \n\n6. Difficulty Levels\nEasy: Basic recall or straightforward application. Medium: Moderate complexity or reasoning required. Difficult: Deeper understanding or multi-step reasoning needed. Hard: Advanced, scenario-based, or requiring interdisciplinary thinking. Insane: Exceptionally challenging, demanding innovation or integration of multiple fields.\n \n\nHow to Use the Prompt\nExtract key content from the document and prioritize it based on weights. Use the outlined fields to systematically generate questions. Ensure a balance of question categories and difficulty levels. Adapt the output format to suit specific needs (e.g., exporting to quiz platforms, LMS).\n",
